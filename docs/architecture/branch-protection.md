# Branch Protection: Protecting `main` from AI Agents

## Purpose

This document explains the branch protection ruleset applied to `main` and how it ensures that AI coding agents (e.g., Claude Code running in a dev container) cannot push to or merge into `main` without explicit human approval. The ruleset works in combination with a dedicated machine user account (`evanharmon1-bot`) that has Write collaborator access and a scoped fine-grained PAT.

## Applying the Ruleset

An importable copy of the ruleset ships in this repo at
`.github/Branch Protection Ruleset - Protect Main.json`. Apply it through the
GitHub **UI import** — do this only once `build.yml` is on
`main`, so the required
`verify`/`security` checks can actually report.
Importing first wedges the repository: a required check with no workflow to emit
it stays pending forever and blocks every pull request.

> Settings → Rules → Rulesets → **New ruleset ▸ Import a ruleset** → select
> `.github/Branch Protection Ruleset - Protect Main.json`.

To change the ruleset later, **edit the existing one in the UI** (Settings →
Rules → Rulesets → Protect Main) — don't re-import.

**When a template update adds a required check** (this file is an import
template, not live configuration — a `copier update` changes the JSON here and
nothing on GitHub), apply it by hand in that order:

1. **Merge the workflow first.** The job that emits the check must already be on
   `main`.
2. **Then** add the context under Settings → Rules → Rulesets → Protect Main →
   Require status checks to pass.

Doing it the other way round wedges the repository: a required check that has
never reported blocks every pull request, including the one that would add the
workflow. If that happens, remove the context from the ruleset, land the
workflow, and add it back.

**Why the UI, not `gh api … rulesets`:** the REST `POST` is **not idempotent**
(every run creates another "Protect Main" ruleset — silent duplicates), the
`PUT` form needs the live ruleset id, and both currently reject the
`merge_queue` rule with `422 Invalid rule 'merge_queue'`. The UI import handles
every rule type and is the GitHub-native way to apply an exported ruleset.

## Dependabot and Renovate

Routine updates and vulnerability-remediation PRs are owned by **Renovate**
(`renovate.json`, with `vulnerabilityAlerts.enabled=true` and
`osvVulnerabilityAlerts=true`) — do not add a
`dependabot.yml`, which would create competing update PRs. Dependabot still owns
the GitHub-native advisory feed, and it is the only one of the two that reaches
**transitive** dependencies, so the alert setting below is load-bearing rather
than optional — `osvVulnerabilityAlerts` covers direct dependencies only. Enable
these in Settings → Advanced Security:

- Dependabot alerts
- Private vulnerability reporting (used by `.github/SECURITY.md`)

## Security Model Overview

Three independent layers enforce the boundary between AI agent work and production code:

1. **Fine-grained PAT** — Scoped to `contents: write` and `pull_requests: write` on specific repos. This is the token the AI agent uses in the dev container. It cannot modify repo settings, branch protection, or workflows.
2. **Repository ruleset on `main`** — Server-side enforcement that blocks direct pushes, requires PR reviews from a code owner, and mandates passing status checks before merge.
3. **CODEOWNERS file** — Designates the human owner as the required reviewer for all file changes, ensuring the bot's PRs always require human approval.

No single layer is sufficient alone. The PAT controls _what operations the token can attempt_. The ruleset controls _what operations GitHub allows on `main`_. The CODEOWNERS file controls _whose approval counts_.

## Prerequisites

### CODEOWNERS File

The `require_code_owner_review` rule in the ruleset **only works if a `CODEOWNERS` file exists** in the repo. Without it, the rule is silently unenforced. Create one at the repo root or `.github/CODEOWNERS`:

```text
# All files require the repo owner's approval
* @evanharmon1
```

Replace `@evanharmon1` with the GitHub username of the human who should approve all changes.

### Bot Account PAT Permissions

> This covers the **devcontainer agent's** push token (Claude Code running in the
> container). CI _workflows_ (release-please, claude-*, project-automation)
> authenticate separately as the CI **GitHub App** — see
> [security.md](security.md) for that App and its permissions. The ruleset below
> protects `main` from every actor (App, bot PAT, or human) equally.

The machine user account's fine-grained PAT should have these **repository**
permissions and nothing more:

| Permission      | Level          | Purpose                                               |
| --------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Contents        | Read and write | Clone, push, create branches, commit                  |
| Issues          | Read and write | Read the issue graph; apply labels; post comments     |
| Pull requests   | Read and write | Open PRs, update PRs, comment                         |
| Metadata        | Read-only      | Mandatory — granted to every fine-grained PAT         |
| Actions         | Read-only      | Read workflow run status (red-CI triage)              |
| Commit statuses | Read-only      | Read the PR status rollup                             |
| Variables       | Read-only      | Read CI configuration when reasoning about a workflow |

> **There is no `Checks` permission for fine-grained PATs.** Only GitHub Apps can
> hold it — it was briefly offered, then withdrawn. Don't go looking for it: CI
> state comes from **Actions** (workflow runs) and **Commit statuses** (the PR
> rollup), which is what the tooling actually reads.
**Read is cheap; write is the line.** Variables are read-only above for a reason
that is not squeamishness — see the exclusions below.

**Deliberately excluded.** This list is _what the bot needs_, and the distinction
is load-bearing, because the bot's PAT is the **agent's own credential**:
anything running in the bot devcontainer can read it out of the environment.
Every permission here is one a prompt-injected agent has.

| Not granted | Why |
| --- | --- |
| **Workflows** | The agent could rewrite `.github/workflows/`, then let CI run it with every Actions secret. The classic escalation. |
| **Administration** | Rulesets, settings, bypass lists. The bot must not be able to unlock the door it is locked behind. |
| **Variables — write** | Read is granted; write is not. Write could opt a private repo into paid CodeQL or mutate another security/deploy switch without a PR diff. Public CodeQL cannot be disabled with `FULL_SECURITY_SCAN`. |
| **Deployments** | Write lets the agent create deployments, colliding with release-gated deploys. Read buys nothing the agent's loop uses. |
| **Secrets**, **Environments**, **Webhooks**, … | Never needed; each is one more thing a leaked token reaches. |

Variables are **non-secret by design** — GitHub separates Secrets from Variables
precisely so config can be read without exposing credentials. That makes the read
grant above safe, and it depends on the separation being honoured: if a variable
ever holds something sensitive, read becomes exfiltration. Check once, when
adding a variable — not forever.

Grant on demand, with a reason. You can edit a fine-grained PAT's permissions
later without regenerating the token, so there is no cost to waiting until
something is genuinely blocked.

## Rule-by-Rule Explanation

### Target and Conditions

The ruleset targets branches matching `~DEFAULT_BRANCH` and `refs/heads/main`. The `~DEFAULT_BRANCH` is a GitHub alias that always resolves to whatever the repo's default branch is, so even if the default branch name changes, the ruleset follows. Including `refs/heads/main` explicitly is belt-and-suspenders.

### `bypass_actors`

> **Design intent — leave this `pull_request`, not `always`.** Every bypass actor is
> scoped to `bypass_mode: pull_request` on purpose: an admin may _merge_ a
> non-compliant PR (a solo maintainer's own PR, which GitHub won't let them
> self-approve, or a genuinely stuck check) but **cannot push directly to `main`**.
> Widening any bypass to `always` re-enables accidental (or malicious) direct pushes
> to `main` and is a real security loosening — only do it deliberately, and call it
> out in review. A bypass actor is required at all (rather than `bypass_actors: []`)
> because a solo maintainer otherwise can't merge anything; with multiple human
> reviewers you can drop the bypass entirely instead.

Only the **Repository admin** role (`RepositoryRole` id `5`) can bypass these rules,
and only in `pull_request` mode — you can **merge** a PR that hasn't met every
requirement (e.g. your own PR, which GitHub won't let you self-approve, or a stuck
check), but you **cannot push directly to `main`**: a direct push isn't a pull
request, so the bypass doesn't apply and the ruleset rejects it. This prevents
accidental `git push origin main` while still letting a solo maintainer merge. The
bot has only Write access (below Admin), so it can never bypass.

### `deletion`

Prevents deleting the `main` branch. Without this, anyone with write access could delete and recreate `main`, potentially losing branch protection in the process.

### `non_fast_forward`

Blocks force pushes (`git push --force`) to `main`. Force pushes rewrite history and can silently remove commits, including security fixes. This ensures `main`'s history is append-only.

### `creation`

Prevents creating a branch matching the pattern. Since `main` already exists, this blocks scenarios where someone deletes `main` and recreates it (bypassing protection that was on the original branch).

### `required_linear_history`

Enforces a linear commit history on `main` — no merge commits. Combined with `allowed_merge_methods: ["squash", "rebase"]`, this means every PR becomes either a single squashed commit or a rebased series of commits. This makes `git log` on `main` clean and easy to reason about, and simplifies `git bisect` for debugging.

### `pull_request`

This is the core rule that prevents the AI agent from pushing directly to `main`. All changes must come through a pull request. The parameters enforce multiple safeguards:

| Parameter                           | Value                  | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `required_approving_review_count`   | `1`                    | At least one approving review required before merge                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `require_code_owner_review`         | `true`                 | The approving review **must** come from a designated code owner (see CODEOWNERS file). A review from the bot or any non-code-owner does not satisfy this.                                                                     |
| `require_last_push_approval`        | `true`                 | The person who pushed the most recent commit cannot be the one to approve it. Since the bot pushes, the bot cannot self-approve — even if it could submit reviews. A human code owner must approve after the bot's last push. |
| `dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push`     | `true`                 | If the bot pushes new commits after a human approves, the approval is dismissed and the human must re-review. Prevents a pattern where the bot gets approval, then pushes different code and merges.                          |
| `required_review_thread_resolution` | `true`                 | All review comments must be resolved before merge. Prevents merging while a human reviewer still has open concerns.                                                                                                           |
| `allowed_merge_methods`             | `["squash", "rebase"]` | Only squash and rebase merges allowed. No merge commits, consistent with `required_linear_history`.                                                                                                                           |

### `required_status_checks`

All specified CI checks must pass before the PR can merge. The `strict_required_status_checks_policy: true` setting means the PR branch must be up-to-date with `main` before merging — if `main` advances after the checks ran, the checks must re-run. The `do_not_enforce_on_create: true` setting skips enforcement when the branch is first created (before any CI has had a chance to run).

The required checks are the build gates (see [ci-cd.md](ci-cd.md)):

| Check      | Purpose                                                                                          |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `verify`   | Aggregate build gate — rolls up root lint/template validation |
| `security` | gitleaks + dependency audit + Semgrep CE (this repo's SAST engine — it has no CodeQL workflow) |
| `closing-keywords` | Metadata-only PR gate: a same-repository closing keyword may pass only when its issue has no unchecked task-list items; it reports a successful no-op on push, merge-queue, and manual runs |
| `devcontainer-verify` | Aggregate for `devcontainer-build.yml`. Runs on every event with **no `paths:` filter** — a filtered workflow never reports, and a required check that never reports blocks the merge forever. Its `devcontainer-changes` job decides internally, so an unrelated PR is a deliberate, reported no-op. See "Fork pull requests report a vacuous pass" and "`merge_group` runs a credential-free build" below |

Snyk PR/App checks are absent by default. This repo's weekly
`snyk-scheduled.yml` — like the one a generated repo opts into — is advisory and
never a required check; it has no PR or push trigger.
Only a high-consequence repository that deliberately adopts paid Snyk should
consider per-PR scans and decide whether to make them merge requirements.
Generated Node/Python repos with `use_codeql=true` additionally gate on
CodeQL's stable `codeql-verify` aggregate, with public/free, private/paid
routing; see [security.md](security.md).

Requiring the aggregate `verify` (rather than each leaf job) keeps the required-check
list stable as jobs are added inside `build.yml`.

### Fork pull requests report a vacuous pass

`devcontainer-verify` — like `verify` and `security` — is a required check
that a fork pull request can pass **without** its devcontainer content ever
being built or asserted: `devcontainer-build.yml`'s jobs already skip
entirely for a `pull_request` event whose `head.repo.full_name` differs from
this repository (no job here ever runs fork-authored code with a
credential, by design), and the aggregator treats that skip as the
expected, passing outcome. This keeps a fork PR **mergeable** — it is never
permanently stuck behind a required check that can never report — but it
also means the automated check alone proves nothing about a fork PR's
`.devcontainer/**` changes.

### Getting a real signal on a fork PR's devcontainer change

Before approving or merging a pull request from a fork that touches
`.devcontainer/**`, get a real, credentialed CI run:

1. Review the diff first, specifically for anything touching
   `.github/workflows/**` or `scripts/devcontainer-*`. The next step runs
   that content's own workflow definition with full repository credentials,
   so tampering there is the one thing this procedure cannot itself catch —
   this is the same manual-trust decision this repository's fork check
   (`head.repo.full_name == github.repository`) already makes everywhere
   else, not a new technical control.
2. `gh pr checkout <number>` to fetch the fork's branch locally.
3. Push it to a same-repository branch and open a **throwaway** pull request
   from that branch against `main` — never merge it. Because it targets
   `main` from a same-repository branch, `devcontainer-build.yml` runs its
   full credentialed path (`build`, `devcontainer-assert-bot`) against that
   exact content.
4. Watch that PR's checks. Once you have the signal you need, close the
   throwaway PR and delete the branch, then review/merge the original fork
   PR as usual.

Never use `pull_request_target` for this instead: it would run trusted
workflow code against the fork's _data_ while still granting a write-capable
token, which is a materially different (and worse) trust boundary than
temporarily promoting the fork's own content to a same-repository branch a
maintainer chose to trust.

### `merge_group` runs a credential-free build

Organizations using the merge queue produce a `merge_group` event when a
pull request — including one originally opened from a fork — is queued to
merge. GitHub does not expose that pull request's fork-vs-same-repository
origin on a `merge_group` event the way it does on `pull_request`, **and**
that event runs the workflow definition from the queued candidate tree
itself, so a runtime `if:` guard inside `devcontainer-build.yml` is not a
credential boundary: a pull request that also edits this file could simply
not include that guard in its own submitted copy.

The boundary that holds regardless is `permissions:`, which GitHub resolves
into the job's token before any step — trusted or attacker-added — runs.
`build-merge-group` is a dedicated job for this one event, declaring only
`permissions: {contents: read}` — no `packages` scope at all, not merely an
unused one — with no `docker/login-action` step under any condition. Even a
maliciously-edited copy of this job cannot authenticate to the registry,
because the token it is issued has no scope to do so. Widening that block
back to `packages: write` is exactly the conspicuous, reviewable diff
`require_code_owner_review` exists to catch (this repository's CODEOWNERS
covers every file, workflows included). `build-merge-group` still runs and
must still succeed — it validates that the devcontainer image builds — but
`devcontainer-verify` does not expect `devcontainer-assert-bot` to run on
`merge_group` at all: its registry cache is a static field in
`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, not a workflow expression this repository
can condition per job, so rather than risk a partial credential-free path,
that job stands down entirely and `devcontainer-verify` treats the skip as
the expected, passing outcome.

## Applying This Ruleset to Other Repos

This ruleset ships with every repo generated from harmon-init. To replicate manually:

1. Create a `CODEOWNERS` file with `* @evanharmon1`
2. Create a branch ruleset targeting `~DEFAULT_BRANCH` with the same rules
3. Add the bot as a Write collaborator
4. Update the `required_status_checks` to match that repo's CI checks
5. Verify by attempting a direct push to main from the bot account — it should be rejected

For an organization with many repos, consider creating an **org-level ruleset** (requires GitHub Team plan) that applies these rules across all repos automatically, eliminating the need to configure each repo individually.

## Future Considerations

- **GitHub App for the devcontainer agent**: CI **workflows** already authenticate as the `evanharmon1-ci` GitHub App (short-lived 1h tokens, no seat cost — see [security.md](security.md)). The remaining machine-user PAT documented above is the **devcontainer agent's** push token; it could likewise move to an App if rotation becomes burdensome. The ruleset protects `main` identically for App tokens, the bot PAT, or any actor.
- **Terraform management**: The GitHub Terraform provider supports `github_repository_ruleset` resources. Codifying the ruleset in Terraform ensures consistency as repos multiply.
- **Additional status checks**: As the CI pipeline matures, add checks for E2E tests (Playwright), accessibility (axe-core), and performance (Lighthouse CI) to the required list.
