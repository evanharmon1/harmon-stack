# ── 1a-ter. Every profile RUNS its docs-presence gate, not just proves
#            it's wired ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# harmon-init#883 AC-2: the reachability checks above only prove a target is
# reachable from `task verify` via a `--dry` grep — never that it PASSES.
# That gap is exactly how #873 shipped: test:label-registry's docs-presence
# check misfired on every linear-profile render (it assumed
# docs/project-management.md always carries the GitHub taxonomy markers,
# which the Linear variant never renders), and the render matrix plus five
# local CI mirrors stayed green because nothing here ever EXECUTED the gate
# against a rendered repo — only cloud review caught it.
#
# Reachability and execution catch different regressions, so keep both: the
# `--dry` grep proves `verify` calls the target, the run proves the target
# passes. There was no reachability grep for test:label-registry either, so
# this adds one.
#
# Unconditional, like every sibling check in this section:
# scripts/test-label-registry.sh and the `test:label-registry` task render in
# every profile with no copier conditional, so there is nothing to gate on.
# The `meta` profile is what makes this catch #873 specifically — it is the
# only one rendering project_management=linear — but a github-variant
# regression is worth catching just as much, and running everywhere is cheap
# (measured under 1s: `time` on the dry-run grep plus the execution, against
# a real --skip-tasks render).
#
# Deliberately NOT the whole of `task verify`. Measured directly (`time task
# --color=false verify`) against a real --skip-tasks meta render: 2:45
# (165.73s) wall-clock, offline, with no `task install` run. Every other
# target in a full `verify` (lint:*, test:hooks, test:statusline,
# test:session-cleanup, test:codex-review, etc.) is profile-INDEPENDENT — it
# would pass or fail identically whatever project_management renders — so
# running it here would quietly make this script the template's only
# end-to-end regression suite for code unrelated to #883, roughly doubling
# each profile's runtime for coverage the issue never asked for.
# test:label-registry is the opposite: its PASS/FAIL depends on the rendered
# project-management variant, and it needs only node+jq+python3 against
# already-rendered JSON/Markdown (no `task install`, no git history beyond
# `git init`, no network).
